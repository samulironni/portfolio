## 2048 AI Development with Python

##### AI_heuristics.py contains 6 different heuristics with different weights to play the game as good as possible
##### Logic.py contains the basic game logic
##### Constants.py contains the game board
##### Puzzle.py is the main program
##### Simulations.py contains the main program without the UI for faster simulations

### Results we got with different depths:
##### Depth = How many moves ahead the AI looks
---
- Depth 1: Max = 7912, Avg = 3417
  
- Depth 2: Max = 79 432, Avg = 31 158

- Depth 3: Max = 103 932, Avg = 29 663

- Depth 4: Max = 133 488, Avg = 63 204
